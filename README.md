# coupled-solvers
This is a repository of some coupled reactive transport solvers I wrote during my time at university.

See coupled_reactive_transport.pdf for a description of the mathematics involved in the folder "coupled".
See dme_mass_transfer.pdf for a description of the mathematics involved in the folder "dme".
